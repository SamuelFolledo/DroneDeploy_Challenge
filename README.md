- Using the VIPER design pattern, and SwiftUI for laying out the views, please build an app that adheres to the layout.
- Clicking on “Go to Page 2” should push “Page 2” on to the UI.
- Clicking on “Logout” from either page should present the “Login Screen” as a modal.
- Clicking on “Login” should always present “Page 1” even if “Page 2” was where “Logout” was clicked.


### Submission
Please submit your code via a github link with a README detailing any necessary steps that need to be taken (e.g. Running: pod install) and specifying the version of Xcode used.
